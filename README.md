# WCS-Lagoon-Analysis
Geospatial analysis of Arctic coastal lagoons in Alaska using Python and Google Earth Engine (GEE) to monitor ecological changes such as algal blooms, ice coverage, and seasonal variation.

---

## Project Overview
This project examines the ecological dynamics of Arctic coastal lagoons using satellite imagery and lagoon shapefiles.  
Our goal is to produce time-series datasets and visualizations that facilitate ecological monitoring and research by utilizing the Google Earth Engine API and Python libraries (GeoPandas, Pandas).
